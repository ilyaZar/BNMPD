TO-DO MYSELF:

@data:
-design availability dummy (share >=0 => energy type available == 1) with code
manually (start with overall dataset; then CA and TX pop out automatically)
- define an "expected signs" table (ask zsuzsanna to check on this)

@model specification
specification remarks
- Von der Anwendung her ergibt es Sinn (meine und Nadjas Meinung), dass man die 
Generalized Dirichlet ausprobiert
- Dabei zu beachten ob seperates Papier (falls viel Arbeit), oder ins 
  bisherige Papier (falls wenig Arbeit) -> Ausprobieren und klären
- deal with panel structure: derive gibbs blocks (see GZ project for similar-
ities as well)

@descriptive_stats
- plot share ts (as done before) plus the prices you are regressing at (provided
by Zsuzsanna)!

- do the spatial 

@theoretical inference and simulations:
- simulations to incorporate dummies:
-2.te Modellvariante, Multinomial Dirichlet, mal als Simulation, die den echten
Daten recht nahe kommt (siehe Datenverlauf Kalifornien und entsprechendes Bild)
+ ausprobiert, aber der jump in dem dummy (beta coefficient am dummy darf nicht
zu groß werden... sonst wirds komisch)

@empirical inference and diagnostics:
- average over sampled states (10,000 mcmc iterations of t=45 long state trajs)
and plot averaged state to see if the resulting patterns match those of the 
measurements (shares/megawatts) for CA and TX
- think of ideas how to generate higher update rates (besides the EIS -> see 
schorfheide tempering paper from the journal of econemetrics etc.)

@code base management
Code beschleunigen:
- erst parallelisiert dann CPP, oder umgekehrt?

Summary of comments from hist last Email, 2019-07-01:

* different types of zeros:
	- With regard to the different types of zeros: one thing is a policy framework
	  decision (here Zsuzsanna has deep knowledge), closer to production are the
	  starting of production facilities (e.g., the first-time connection of a
	  nuclear to the grid), or the cancelling of a plant. Both are endogenous to
	  policy decisions.
	  -> verstehe ich leider garnicht was damit gemeint ist
	 - Wrt 'sudden intermediate zeros': in my view this should mirror a minor
	   economic relevance - small asset-specific investments such that there are no
       lock-in effects at all. 


* regarding regressors:
	- With regard to regressors, we have more generally to separate the
	  availability of necessary ingredients (sun, water, coal, wind)  from
	  policies and plant constructions. In sum, we have a serious problem of
	  endogeneity. @ Zsuzsanna: any idea how to deal with these endogeneities in
	  the supply chain such that we can disentangle the causal impact of policies.
	  I guess its difficult to imagine counterfactuals for most energy carriers
	  except nuclear energy, wind, and sun.
	  -> what exactly is the serious problem of endogeneity? 
	  in a region: effects between energy type produced and availability of its ingredient?
	  -> see what Zsussanna has to say about this: she will probably provide a reasonable regressor set to deal with endogeneity
	  -> we may have to deal with this in the construction of the model as well, but how?
	  -> counterfactuals, instruments etc as possible solutions applicable to our model???

TO-DO @ZSUZSANNA:

interpret the signs please @Zsuszanna and @Paul

forecasting way way way back, energy transitions need to be predicting: clarify
the aim of the paper!
