Hi all,


allright then. Addressing the points that were mentioned:


@Zsuzsanna regarding the model 3A and 3B: 
the difference is that 3B does not have a constant term/level effect at a share where the utilization dummy is present. For california this is coal. This is because I noticed (in some cases but not all!) a problem with the level effect and the utilization dummy interaction. They tend to cancel each other in their contribution to the share, think like this: you have a high constant/level effect,  in general, whenever you also observe a high share/fraction of the energy type but(!) if that fraction also has zero share value for some time and jumps only afterwards to that high level, the availability dummy representing this jump, also becomes important for explaining the high share/fraction (i.e. contributing in similar fashion as does the level effect/constant term). 
Now very roughly speaking this might induce high correlation of coefficients at these variables; in a Bayesian setting one observes  therefor a high correlations of MCMC draws and a slow convergence to the marginal posteriors i.e. an in-efficient estimation (which I did from time to time); a textbook approach to remedy these effects would use more MCMC samples or think about a better sampling/updating scheme or change the model specification some other things, in a theoretically perfectly world; but we are not estimating the final model and we were focusing on exploring various modelling possibilities and comparing them in general, and so, instead of diving into details here,  I just decided to monitor this effect, also at the specification with cummulative capacities; thus I used the baseline 3A and then out of curiosity variant 3B without a constant term. 
Comparing them now: take a look at the elasticities of model 3A: cumcap positive, coal avail positive, an elasticity of the constant term not included (meaningless because the constant never changes) but the constant would be insignificant, given the confidence interval from the table at page 63: mean is 0.63787 with standard deviation 1.2747. Now, a naive OLS approach: drop variables that are not significant so model 3B arises: same as model 3A but no constant, but as it turns out coal cumcap still positive but for whatever reason one gest coal_avail negative: it starts to account for the missing level effect in a weird fashion; though insignificant before the constant term being missing influences coal _avail; this is good to know in general so the specification is included
@Nadja A: yes I did ESS and mcmc convergence diagnostics of the traces, autocorrelation etc. They looked good for most parameters and good enough for a few exceptions. 
@Nadja B: What remains to do is DIC/WAIC and maybe (as you said) the quantile/pitt residual plots. One may do in sample forecasts, too. I'll focus on DIC/WAIC.

Yet again a reminder; what works nicely with California or Texas need not carry over to other states or the final panel model specification

-> So in principle, it is possible to toy around with another time series model and include some more policy variables for selected US states like California, or Texas; However, we will need a panel model using all states jointly: then, we'll have to re-estimate all specifications with different policy variables anyway and  re-run all diagnostics (DIC/WAIC/in sample forecasts/ quantile plots) once again for the panel model to determine the final model specification.

Based on that my suggestion is to just move to the panel model implementation and see what variables work best and what DIC/WAIC say about model selection in this context. What do you think?

Cheers
Ilya


TO-DO MYSELF:

@data:
-design availability dummy (share >=0 => energy type available == 1) with code
manually (start with overall dataset; then CA and TX pop out automatically)
- define an "expected signs" table (ask zsuzsanna to check on this)

@model specification
specification remarks
- Von der Anwendung her ergibt es Sinn (meine und Nadjas Meinung), dass man die 
Generalized Dirichlet ausprobiert
- Dabei zu beachten ob seperates Papier (falls viel Arbeit), oder ins 
  bisherige Papier (falls wenig Arbeit) -> Ausprobieren und klären
- deal with panel structure: derive gibbs blocks (see GZ project for similar-
ities as well)

@descriptive_stats
- plot share ts (as done before) plus the prices you are regressing at (provided
by Zsuzsanna)!

- do the spatial 

@theoretical inference and simulations:
- simulations to incorporate dummies:
-2.te Modellvariante, Multinomial Dirichlet, mal als Simulation, die den echten
Daten recht nahe kommt (siehe Datenverlauf Kalifornien und entsprechendes Bild)
+ ausprobiert, aber der jump in dem dummy (beta coefficient am dummy darf nicht
zu groß werden... sonst wirds komisch)

@empirical inference and diagnostics:
- average over sampled states (10,000 mcmc iterations of t=45 long state trajs)
and plot averaged state to see if the resulting patterns match those of the 
measurements (shares/megawatts) for CA and TX
- think of ideas how to generate higher update rates (besides the EIS -> see 
schorfheide tempering paper from the journal of econemetrics etc.)

@code base management
Code beschleunigen:
- erst parallelisiert dann CPP, oder umgekehrt?

Summary of comments from hist last Email, 2019-07-01:

* different types of zeros:
	- With regard to the different types of zeros: one thing is a policy framework
	  decision (here Zsuzsanna has deep knowledge), closer to production are the
	  starting of production facilities (e.g., the first-time connection of a
	  nuclear to the grid), or the cancelling of a plant. Both are endogenous to
	  policy decisions.
	  -> verstehe ich leider garnicht was damit gemeint ist
	 - Wrt 'sudden intermediate zeros': in my view this should mirror a minor
	   economic relevance - small asset-specific investments such that there are no
       lock-in effects at all. 


* regarding regressors:
	- With regard to regressors, we have more generally to separate the
	  availability of necessary ingredients (sun, water, coal, wind)  from
	  policies and plant constructions. In sum, we have a serious problem of
	  endogeneity. @ Zsuzsanna: any idea how to deal with these endogeneities in
	  the supply chain such that we can disentangle the causal impact of policies.
	  I guess its difficult to imagine counterfactuals for most energy carriers
	  except nuclear energy, wind, and sun.
	  -> what exactly is the serious problem of endogeneity? 
	  in a region: effects between energy type produced and availability of its ingredient?
	  -> see what Zsussanna has to say about this: she will probably provide a reasonable regressor set to deal with endogeneity
	  -> we may have to deal with this in the construction of the model as well, but how?
	  -> counterfactuals, instruments etc as possible solutions applicable to our model???

TO-DO @ZSUZSANNA:

interpret the signs please @Zsuszanna and @Paul

forecasting way way way back, energy transitions need to be predicting: clarify
the aim of the paper!
