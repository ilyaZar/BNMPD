Description: Implements estimation of Bayesian nonparametric multivariate 
    panel data models for multivariate response/dependent variable
    settings. Estimation is performed using Particle Gibbs with ancestor
    sampling which is a method combining MCMC (here, Gibbs sampling) and
    SMC methods (here, a standard bootstrap particle filter and a particle
    EIS filter) to sample from the high dimensional and highly nonlinear
    posterior densities of model parameters and latent state variables.
